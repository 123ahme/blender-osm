* **blender-osm** imports buildings from OpenStreetMap. Building height and number of floors are used to create the final scene. Composition into 3D parts for a building with the complex structure is also processed. A large number of roof shapes is supported. If a terrain is provided, buildings are placed on the terrain automatically.
* **blender-osm** downloads and imports real world terrain data with resolution about 30 meter.
* River, lakes, forests, vegetation are imported as polygons. If a terrain is provided, they are projected on the terrain.
* Highways, paths and railways are imported as edges. If a terrain is provided, they are projected on the terrain.
